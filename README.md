This code is a data preprocessing and linear regression modeling pipeline for housing data. 
It involves 
loading the data, 
handling missing values, 
splitting the data, 
performing feature engineering, 
and training a linear regression model. 
The final step evaluates the model's performance on the test set using the R-squared score.
